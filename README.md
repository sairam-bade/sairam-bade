Hello! I'm Sai Ram, a passionate individual currently pursuing Business Analytics at the University of Texas at Dallas. With over 5 years of experience as a Data Engineer, I have gained expertise in various technologies including Python, Scala, UNIX, Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Kafka, SQL, Microsoft Azure, and AWS.

Driven by a deep interest in data and analytics, I made the decision to further enhance my skills by pursuing a master's degree. Throughout my academic journey, I excelled in R, SAS, Advanced Statistics, Machine Learning, Tableau, and Power BI, which are essential tools for data science and analytics. My proficiency in these areas enables me to comprehend the entire data lifecycle, from its origin to transformations, and the resulting business value.

Apart from my technical interests, I have a love for traveling, particularly to serene woodland destinations. Exploring nature allows me to unwind and find inspiration.

If you ever require any technical assistance or career advice, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at [Email](sairam.bade@outlook.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sairambade/). I am always eager to collaborate and contribute to exciting projects in the world of data and analytics.
